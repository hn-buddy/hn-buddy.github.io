# HN Buddy Web Extension

Basic tuning of the HN interface:

- Relocates the upvote/downvote links.
- Highlights recent comments.
- Highlights favorite users.

Installation:

- Use the `.xpi` file matching your browser.
- Build your own `.xpi` with `xpi-build.sh`.

I haven't been able to outsmart Firefox Android Nightly: it hates extensions with passion and won't let you install one no matter what.
